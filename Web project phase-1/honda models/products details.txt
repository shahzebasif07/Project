Audi R8:
Audi’s luscious R8 is beautiful to behold, easy to live with, and simply marvelous to drive—everything you’d want in a sports car. The R8 is powered by a 5.2-liter 540-hp V-10; the V10 Plus makes 610 hp. All-wheel drive is standard as is a seven-speed automatic. The handsome interior features a 12.3-inch configurable display in lieu of traditional gauges; there is also 4G LTE connectivity and Wi-Fi hotspot capability. Both a coupe and convertible are available.

nissan gt-r8:
Doesn’t matter what you call it—GT-R or, more fittingly, Godzilla—Nissan’s range topper is a supercar-stomping, high-tech dynamo. Its 3.8-liter twin-turbo V-6 makes a mighty 565 hp while a six-speed dual-clutch automatic and all-wheel drive team up to put all that power to the pavement. The GT-R’s quick steering, rigid structure and adjustable suspension can make even amateurs feel positively heroic from behind the wheel. Want more? Check out the track-ready NISMO-tuned variant with 600 hp.

The gullwings are gone, but the GT is still set to swoop in and snag buyers away from its archnemesis, the Porsche 911. The GT—along with its roadster counterpart—has a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 connected to a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. This combination delivers 469 horsepower and gives the GT a top speed of 189 mph (188 for the roadster). The GT S brings 515 hp. All models have active aerodynamic louvers that adjust drag and engine cooling on the fly.
